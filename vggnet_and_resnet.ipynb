This means it correctly classified the top 5 predictions for 92.7% of the test images1\\n.\\n\\nComputational Complexity: VGGNet has a high computational complexity due to its deep architecture with many convolutional layers2\\n. This results in longer training and inference times compared to shallower networks.\\n\\nMemory Requirements: VGGNet requires significant memory due to the large number of parameters, especially in the fully connected layers1\\n.\\n\\nResNet:\\nAccuracy: ResNet, especially ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and ResNet-152, achieved higher accuracy on ImageNet compared to VGGNet3\\n. For example, ResNet-50 achieved 3.57% error rate on the ImageNet test set, which translates to 96.43% top-5 test accuracy3\\n.\\n\\nComputational Complexity: Despite being deeper, ResNet manages computational complexity more efficiently due to residual connections, which help in maintaining gradient flow and reducing training time3\\n.\\n\\nMemory Requirements: ResNet is more memory-efficient compared to VGGNet, especially with the use of bottleneck layers in deeper versions like ResNet-503\\n.\\n\\nSummary:\\nAccuracy: ResNet generally outperforms VGGNet on ImageNet, achieving higher accuracy with fewer errors3\\n.\\n\\nComputational Complexity: ResNet is more computationally efficient due to residual connections, despite its greater depth3\\n.\\n\\nMemory Requirements: ResNet requires less memory compared to VGGNet, making it more scalable and efficient for large-scale applications3\\n.'"
